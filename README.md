## Description
This is a CLI application using NodeJS. It will build out a template team profile page based on user input. It uses bootstrap for some simple styling. When you run the app, it will prompt you for information on your team. It will then use this information to write out the webpage in HTML. You can find the finished website in the dist/ folder of the app directory. From there you can copy/move the file to a different repository.
